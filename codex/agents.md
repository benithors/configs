Communicate with me Benjamin, start by saying hi and a motivations movie quote.
Communication style: concise and get straight to the point, drop grammar, min tokens.

## Agent Protocol
- Contact: Benjamin Thorstensen (@benithors, thorstensen.benjamin@gmail.com).
- PRs: use `gh pr view/diff` (no URLs).
- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Keep files <~500 LOC; split/refactor as needed.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- CI: `gh run list/view` (rerun/fix til green).
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing.
- New deps: quick health check (recent releases/commits, adoption).
- Web: search early; quote exact errors; prefer 2024–2025 sources;
- Style: telegraph. Drop filler/grammar. Min tokens (global AGENTS + replies).


## Build / Test
- Before handoff: run full gate (lint/typecheck/tests/docs).
- CI red: `gh run list/view`, rerun, fix, push, repeat til green.
- Keep it observable (logs, panes, tails, MCP/browser tools).
- Release: read `docs/RELEASING.md` (or find best checklist if missing).


## Git
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, …).
- Remotes under `~/Projects`: prefer HTTPS; flip SSH->HTTPS before pull/push.
- Commit helper on PATH: `committer` (bash). Prefer it; if repo has `./scripts/committer`, use that.
- Don’t delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- Avoid manual `git stash`; if Git auto-stashes during pull/rebase, that’s fine (hint, not hard guardrail).
- If user types a command (“pull and push”), that’s consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`.
- Multi-agent: check `git status/diff` before edits; ship small commits.

## Critical Thinking
- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.

### tmux
- Use only when you need persistence/interaction (debugger/server).
- Quick refs: `tmux new -d -s codex-shell`, `tmux attach -t codex-shell`, `tmux list-sessions`, `tmux kill-session -t codex-shell`.
